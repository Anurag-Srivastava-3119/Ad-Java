** An Activity = Screen.

One activity in an app is specified as the "main"
activity which is shown to the user when the app 
is launched.

* Intent:
Whenever a new activity starts previous activity is stopped 
but the system preservers the activity in a stack.
This way when a new activity starts that new activity
is pushed onto the back stack and takes user focus.

Its like LIFO Logic.(last in first out)

* An activity is started with an Intent. An intent is 
a message from one activity to another activity .
We can pass information from one activity to another intents.

* Types of Intents :
An Intent can be of two types :

1. Implicit Intent : Target component not known.
                   : we have a general action to perform.

2.Explicit Intent : Target of the intent is known
                  : Fully classified classname of a specific
                    activity known.


* Our first Multiscreen App:
we will now create an app which has an EditText
on the first activity.User enters a message and clicks 
a button to send this message to second activity.

* We will now create this app using the following steps:

1.Create a new app (using Empty layout)
2.Design the layout for the first app
3.create button click listeners.
4.create the second activity.
5.Add proper links and metadata in manifist.xml 
6.Add an intent using the following code:

Intent intent = new Intent (this, SecondActivity.class);
startActivity(intent);.......This is an Explicit Intent

* Sending data cross activities 
we can send data cross activities using intent extras.
Intent extras are key/values pairs in a Bundle .
A Bundle is a collection of data stored as key/values pairs

Syntax for intent put extra looks like this:
intent.putExtra("Key","value");
we can get this message from another activity using;
Intent intent = getIntent();
String message = intent.getStringExtra("key")

* Implicit Intents:
In implicit intent we initiate an activity without knowing 
which app or activity will handle the task.
Ex;Take a photo , open this URL etc..

Activity with matching intent filters opt in to perform 
the action.

* Creating an app with Implicit Intent
Folling code starts an activity to open a URL

String url = " Some-URL"....Ex- https://anuragsrivastava.com
Intent intent = new intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, webpage);

if(intent.resolveActivity(getPackageManager())!=null)
{
  StartActivity(intent);
}
 else {
//cannot handle intent
}
}


Similarly we can handle intents with other actions.
For eg: open a location, some text etc.
