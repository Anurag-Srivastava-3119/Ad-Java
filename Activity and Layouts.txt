* What is an Activity?
A single focused thing that the user can do 
In Laymans term ...Activity = Screen 

Activity has Layouts -- It defines how Views  are displayed 

* Types of Layouts in Andriod.
If you go to the palette you will find a lot of layouts .
We can use any of these. Ex Linear layout, Constraints Layout..etc

* LINEAR LAYOUT :
 Arrange its collections of views in a straight horizontal or vertical 
 row.
 Gravity attribute can be used for alignment.

* Required attributes of a Linear Layout.
1. layout width -- can be match parent/wrap content/ some value dp(dimentions pixels)
2. layout height -- can be match parent/ wrap content /some value dp.
3. orientation -- can be Horizontal or vertical.

** Note- Never close ur Emulator on every run when you change the app 
Emulator is a resource hungry program and will take time to launch.

* Relative Layout-
-Elements are aligned relative to each other.
-Attribute like andriod:layout_alignParentTop are used to 
declare position of views .

The relative layout is available in legacy tab in palette

Legacy tab in palette-
some view layouts in andriod studio are replaced with better
counterparts.

ListView is replaced with Recycler View
GridView is replaced with ConstraintLayout
TabHost is replaced with Tablayout
Relative is replaced with ConstraintLayout


* Important Note..-
- Component view show certain warnings sometimes
correcting these by following good practice is recommended.
-You can resize the preview as per the device of your liking in 
design view itself.
-Andriod Stdio uses Gradle as the build system.
-Project structure of andriod is very simple and straight forword.
- you dont have to remember all the attributes of every view.


*String.xml file -
This file contains string resources in xml format

<string name = "app">Anurag </string>
-Here "app" is Identifier ....and Anurag is the value.
We can use <b> bold </b> and <i> Italic </i> tags inside 
the text in string.xml .other HTML Tags are ignored
Escape sequence characters like '\n' are also allowed.


*Scroll View:
Scrollview is a viewGroup used to create Scrollable views.
It contains just one child which can be greater
than the screen height and can be scrolled.

Scroll view offers many attributes which is used to customize it.


*Horizontal Scrollview:
It is very similar to scrollview but instead of vertical 
scrolling it provides functionality for horizontal scrolling

*Logging in Andriod 
we can log a message to the console using:
Log.d("Tag","Log this message");
similarly we can use Log.i for info, Log.e for error etc.

*Constraints Layout;
contraints layout allows us to position widgets by applying constraints 
(You can Imagine a constraints as a Spring)

We can add a baseline constraints  on widgets inside the constraints layout by right clicking>
show Baseline and finally adding the baseline constraints.
