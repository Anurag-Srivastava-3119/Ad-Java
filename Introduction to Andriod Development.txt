Andriod is one of the most Popular Operating System,
with over 88% of phones running Andriod.

* Xml and Kotlin code:

An xml file is used to build layout in Andriod. Layouts
are static pages(Screens) which can be manipulated using 
Kotlin/java code (Programmatically)
Declaring UI's in XML enables us to better seperate the 
presentation of our application from the code that controls 
its behaviour

Andriod studio is an IDE the makes it easy for us to write and 
build andriod application very conveniently we can create emulators 
(virtual andriod phones), see previews and build UI layouts using drag 
and drop features

The layout editor is used to quickly bulid layouts by dragging UI  
elements which is easier to write XML code by hand.

editor.
