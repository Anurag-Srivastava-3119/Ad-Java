* In this chapter we will create our first andriod app .
I dont expect you to know anything but will walk you 
though the steps to build your first Andriod App !

* What is an APK ?

An APK is a  collection of different files (like code, audio,
video.etc) compiled and bundled into a single file.

* What is an AVD ?

AVD stands for Andriod Virtual Device 
AVD is an emulator cofiguration that simulates a 
physical Andriod device.

*Andriod UI Layouts --

view are the base class for widgets 
like -- Buttons, textfile etc.

view =Basic building blocks 
viewGroups holds view and view Group.(think view Groups as a container)

*XML vs java in Andriod 

XML is the Skeleton code which describe the UI layout and java derives this XML (functionalities)

* Important Notes :
 
1. Andriod Studio is a resource hungry program . you need to have patience while using it.
2. Sometimes andriod studio might download files from the internet so keep your wifi/Hotspot ready.
3. In very rare case your firewall might block andriod studio In that case you will need to allow it.(explicitly)
4. If your computer is slow use USB debugging to use your phone as an AVD replacement.
5. If you are using an old pc then make sure that the Virtualization is ON (Under Task manager)

* Creating our App :

1. click on create a new project.
2. click on Empty activity.
3. click next.
4. Type the name of the app and click finish.
5. wait for gradle build to Finish.

* The R.Java file
 Andriod R.java file contains resource IDe for all the resources .
We can use it to access view from our java files .

button = findViewById (R.id.mybutton);

* Adding Event Listeners
  We can add click listeners by using SetOnClickListener method as follows:

  button.setOnClickListener(new View.OnclickListener(){
  @Override
  public void onClick(view v){
  //Action here you can add "Toast"
  }
  });

* Andriod : onclick attribute
  
  the onclick attributes can be set for the button element
  in XML Layout

  andriod : onclick = "send Message"  --In XML
  public void send message (view view){
   //code Here
   }.
